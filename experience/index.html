          As a supervisor, I am responsible to ensuring that the games are able to run smoothly and that the facilities are
          prepared before and after games. I also have to evaluate and manage other intramural officials. This position allows me
          to improve my leadership, communication, and decision-making skills when working with my fellow supervisors, 
          officials, and intramural sport participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an official, I have to make quick judgement calls and be able to articulate an explanation for my decisions.
          I also have to communicate with fellow officials in order to make the right decision in a short amount of time.

          On the Research & Insights Committe I am responsible for conducting meaningful surveys and research to ensure
          that the members are getting the experience they expect and hope for. Working with a team, I put together purposeful questions
          and produce meaningful results for the Executive Board to use in their decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member, I learn from professionals in various different roles in sports through weekly events.
          I attended a virtual trip to New York to have conversations with leaders in New York based companies.
          I participate in a mentorship program that gives me a one-on-one relationship with someone in the field I am hoping to join.
